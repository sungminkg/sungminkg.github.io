This past May, I had a wonderful experience, delivering a seminar titled, "Federated Learning Implementation in Python using Socket Communication" as part of the 'Artificial Intelligence Communications' course at Sogang University.

In this talk, I discussed the technological importance of federated learning and how to address data heterogeneity. I also demonstrated federated learning implementation with 5 laptops through wireless communication.
