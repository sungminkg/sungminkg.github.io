Poster Presentation, "Reconsidering LLM Uncertainty Estimation Methods in the Wild", at ACL 2025

![Talk]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/acl_talk.jpg)

✨ I had the invaluable experience of presenting our poster “Reconsidering LLM Uncertainty Estimation Methods in the Wild” at ACL 2025!

I’m deeply grateful to my team — especially Prof. [Salman Avestimehr](https://www.avestimehr.com/), my wonderful mentors [Yavuz Bakman](https://ybakman.com/), and [Duygu Yaldiz](https://www.duygunuryaldiz.com/) — for their guidance and collaboration.

As this was my first conference, it was such a privilege to attend ACL, explore other posters and talks, engage in inspiring conversations with authors and share novel research ideas. I walked away with so many fresh ideas and insights — truly an unforgettable experience! 🚀
