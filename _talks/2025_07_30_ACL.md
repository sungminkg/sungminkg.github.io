![Talk](/images/ACL_talk.JPG)

‚ú® I had the invaluable experience of presenting our poster ‚ÄúReconsidering LLM Uncertainty Estimation Methods in the Wild‚Äù at ACL 2025!

I‚Äôm deeply grateful to my team ‚Äî especially Prof. [Salman Avestimehr](https://www.avestimehr.com/), my wonderful mentors [Yavuz Bakman](https://ybakman.com/), and [Duygu Yaldiz](https://www.duygunuryaldiz.com/) ‚Äî for their guidance and collaboration.

As this was my first conference, it was such a privilege to attend ACL, explore other posters and talks, engage in inspiring conversations with authors and share novel research ideas. I walked away with so many fresh ideas and insights ‚Äî truly an unforgettable experience! üöÄ
