This November, I had the great honor of presenting my work, *“GEM: A Scale-Aware and Distribution-Sensitive Sparse Fine-Tuning Framework for Effective Downstream Adaptation,”* at the USC ECE Annual Research Festival.

I shared the core ideas behind how gradient-to-weight ratio and entropy-based parameter selection enable effective fine-tuning with high sparsity and discussed its implications for efficient adaptation of large models. I was thrilled to receive the best poster award for this presentation, and the experience motivated me even further to push this line of research forward.
