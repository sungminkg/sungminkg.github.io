Hi! I’m a 2nd year Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Southern California. I work with [Professor Salman Avestimehr](https://www.avestimehr.com/) in the [vITAL Lab](https://www.avestimehr.com/vital-lab), where I study uncertainty estimation in large language models (LLMs). My recent work focuses on evaluating uncertainty in open-ended generation without access to supporting documents, and expanding it to in-context scenarios involving retrieved or provided context. I also collaborate with [Professor Sunwoo Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/sunwoolee/home) on scalable machine learning systems—specifically, parameter-efficient fine-tuning and communication-efficient federated learning.

My research centers on building trustworthy and scalable machine learning systems, with a particular focus on uncertainty estimation in LLM-generated answers and efficient model adaptation. I’m especially interested in bridging theory and practice—exploring how internal model signals such as gradients and attention maps can be leveraged to improve both the reliability and efficiency of modern machine learning systems. I am currently working on developing uncertainty estimation methods that are robust under distribution shifts, ensuring reliability even in out-of-domain or context-misaligned scenarios.

Previously, I earned my B.S. in Electronic Engineering and Artificial Intelligence from Sogang University in South Korea, where I worked with [Professor Hongseok Kim](https://nice.sogang.ac.kr/) on distributed optimization and federated learning.
