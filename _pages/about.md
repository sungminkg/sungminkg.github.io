Hi! I’m a 2nd year Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Southern California. I work with [Salman Avestimehr](https://www.avestimehr.com/) in the [vITAL Lab](https://www.avestimehr.com/vital-lab), where I study uncertainty estimation in large language models (LLMs). I also collaborate with [Sunwoo Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/sunwoolee/home), focusing on scalable machine learning systems.

My research centers on building (1) **trustworthy** and (2) **scalable** machine learning systems.

**1) Trustworthy Machine Learning**  
I focus on uncertainty estimation in LLMs, especially under realistic and practical scenarios. My recent work explores uncertainty estimation in in-context generation—where the model is provided with or retrieves relevant documents—as well as open-ended settings without any external grounding. I am also investigating how to develop uncertainty estimation methods that remain reliable under distribution shifts and in out-of-domain conditions.

**2) Scalable Machine Learning**  
I study how to enhance learning scalability by leveraging and processing gradient signals. Specifically, I work on parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods that identify and train only the most relevant parameters using gradient-based importance scores. I have also explored ways to reduce communication costs in federated learning by utilizing gradient information more efficiently.

I’m especially interested in bridging theory and practice—extracting and utilizing internal model signals such as gradients, attention maps, and token probabilities to improve the reliability, efficiency, and robustness of modern machine learning systems.

Previously, I earned my B.S. in Electronic Engineering and Artificial Intelligence from Sogang University in South Korea, where I worked with [Hongseok Kim](https://nice.sogang.ac.kr/) on distributed optimization and federated learning, covering both algorithmic design and practical implementation.
