Hi! I’m a 2nd-year Master's student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California, working closely with Prof. [Salman Avestimehr](https://www.avestimehr.com/) and Prof. [Sai Praneeth Karimireddy](https://spkreddy.org). I also collaborate with Prof. [Sunwoo Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/sunwoolee/home). Previously, I received my B.S. in Electronic Engineering from Sogang University, where I worked with Prof. [Hongseok Kim](https://nice.sogang.ac.kr/).

<ins>**I am applying for Fall 2026 Ph.D. programs, actively seeking opportunities!**</ins>

My research focuses on building **trustworthy** LLMs. I mainly work on **uncertainty quantification** in LLMs for reliable decision-making. Moving forward, I aim to extend my research in **reasoning** and **interpretability**, to better understand the internal mechanisms of large models and leverage these insights to enhance their reliability and safety. I am also interested in advancing these directions toward multi-modal and multi-agent systems, with the long-term goal of developing trustworthy agents that can operate safely and transparently in the real world. Besides, I have research experience in federated learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

You can find my specific research interest in the [Research](https://sungminkg.github.io/research/) section.
