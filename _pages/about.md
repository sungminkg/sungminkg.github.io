Hi! I’m a 2nd-year Master's student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California. **I am applying for Ph.D. programs in Fall 2026 and actively seeking opportunities!**

<br>
I work with Prof. [Salman Avestimehr](https://www.avestimehr.com/) in the [vITAL Lab](https://www.avestimehr.com/vital-lab), where I study uncertainty quantification in LLMs for reliable decision making. I also collaborate with Prof. [Sunwoo Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/sunwoolee/home), focusing on parameter-efficient fine-tuning and communication-efficient federated learning. Previously, I received my B.S. in Electronic Engineering from Sogang University, where I worked on federated learning and distributed optimization with [Hongseok Kim](https://nice.sogang.ac.kr/).
