Hi! I’m a M.S. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Machine Learning & Data Science Track) at the University of Southern California.

My research focuses on **Distributed AI** and **Efficient Machine Learning**. I am particularly interested in reducing communication and computation costs in federated learning, and leveraging foundation models on limited resources through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. I am also currently working with [Professor Sunwoo Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/sunwoolee/home).

Previously, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Electronic Engineering and Artificial Intelligence from Sogang University in South Korea. I worked with [Professor Hongseok Kim](https://nice.sogang.ac.kr/), focusing on algorithmic research and implementation of federated learning.

Besides machine learning, I enjoy playing tennis and soccer, and watching baseball.
