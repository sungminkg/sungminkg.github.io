Hi! I’m a 2nd-year Master's student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California, advised by Prof. [Salman Avestimehr](https://www.avestimehr.com/). I also collaborate with Prof. [Sunwoo Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/sunwoolee/home). Previously, I received my B.S. in Electronic Engineering from Sogang University, where I worked with Prof. [Hongseok Kim](https://nice.sogang.ac.kr/).

<ins>**I am applying for Fall 2026 Ph.D. programs, actively seeking opportunities!**</ins>

My research focuses on building **trustworthy** and **scalable** machine learning systems. I work on uncertainty quantification in large language models to enable reliable decision making, and on parameter-efficient fine-tuning and federated learning methods that improve the scalability and efficiency of model adaptation. Broadly, I am interested in developing methods that balance robustness, interpretability, efficiency, and practicality in real-world applications. 

You can find my specific research interest in the [Research](https://sungminkg.github.io/research/) section.
