Hi! I’m a graduate researcher interested in developing **trustworthy and scalable machine learning systems**, with a focus on **large language models (LLMs)**, **uncertainty estimation**, and **efficient model adaptation**. My research lies at the intersection of theory and practice — I explore how internal model signals such as **gradients** and **activations** can be used to improve both the **reliability** and **efficiency** of modern ML systems.

I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Machine Learning & Data Science Track) at the University of Southern California. I work with [Professor Salman Avestimehr](https://www.avestimehr.com/) in the [vITAL Lab](https://www.avestimehr.com/vital.html), focusing on efficient LLM fine-tuning and uncertainty quantification. I also collaborate with [Professor Sunwoo Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/sunwoolee/home) on scalable machine learning systems.

Previously, I earned my B.S. in Electronic Engineering and Artificial Intelligence from Sogang University in South Korea, where I worked with [Professor Hongseok Kim](https://nice.sogang.ac.kr/) on distributed optimization and federated learning.

Besides machine learning, I enjoy playing tennis and soccer, and watching baseball.
