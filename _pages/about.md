Hi! I’m a 2nd-year Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Machine Learning and Data Science Track) at the University of Southern California.  
<br>
I work with [Salman Avestimehr](https://www.avestimehr.com/) in the [vITAL Lab](https://www.avestimehr.com/vital-lab), where I study uncertainty quantification in LLMs for reliable decision making. I also collaborate with [Sunwoo Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/sunwoolee/home), focusing on parameter-efficient fine-tuning and communication-efficient federated learning. Previously, I received my B.S. in Electronic Engineering from Sogang University, where I worked on federated learning and distributed optimization with [Hongseok Kim](https://nice.sogang.ac.kr/).
